<p class="articletitle">"New Year's Health Letter"</p>
<p>Ciril J. Godec, MD</p>
<p>"Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out." - Robert Collier</p>

<p>This is the time of year when people make resolutions about their life, health, relationships, money, new interests, etc. Although many of the resolutions remain unrealized, these reflections are good for us, as they give us a pause to reflect on the past year and to plan for the future. In this letter I want to address what you yourself can do for your own mental and physical health rather than solely relying on your health care providers.</p>

<p>The American Medical Association is encouraging all practicing physicians, regardless of specialty, to talk to our patients about the biological impact of some bad lifestyle choices, including smoking, unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity, poor sleeping patterns, and lack of social interactions. Most doctors have limited time to discuss these lifestyle issues. Indeed, it is difficult to follow this recommendation; most doctors are under time pressure and concentrate mostly on the specific problem that brought the patient to the office. I hope that more insurance agencies will start to compensate physicians who follow this AMA suggestion for their discussion of prevention of the most frequent diseases of aging, especially cardiovascular problems and cancer. The preventative discussion in physicians' offices could lead to a significant decrease in health care costs, which is now about 18% of GNP, or $3 trillion in 2013 in the US, far more than any other developed country in the world.</p>

<p>Let's start with smoking, the most preventable cause of diseases in the US today. Smoking is responsible for 480,000 deaths per year, including 42,000 deaths due to secondhand smoking. Smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. The total economic cost of smoking is about $300 billion a year. Over $40 million (16.8%) of all US adults smoke. These figures are staggering. If you still smoke, stop today. Get help from family and nonsmoking friends; keep busy. There are many support groups available on the Internet that are ready to help you in your effort to quit smoking. There is good news: smoking in the US has already started to decrease, especially among young people.</p>

<p>Unlike smoking, obesity is on the increase. In US today, two-thirds of adults and one third of children are overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9) or obese (BMI 30.0 or above). Obesity has now become the new smoking. The health toll for obesity is sharply on the rise, from high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease. The average adult in US today weighs 26 pounds more than in the 1950s. The medical bill for obesity is enormous at $190 billion a year. If you are obese, make a plan to lose weight. You cannot do it quickly, but you can start immediately, today. There are proven strategies to fight obesity: reduce portion size; eat slowly, as it takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain that it is full; drink one to two glasses of water 5 to 10 minutes before the meal; use a food diary (use your iphone) to keep track of the food you consume; reduce sweets, sodas and fruit juices; eat as much fish and vegetables as you like; be moderate with red meat and hard liquor; have a glass of red wine during dinner (one for woman, two for man). Vitamins are not necessary: the best vitamins come from healthy nutrition.</p>

<p>Next to healthy nutrition, physical activity (PA) is the second most important item in keeping you healthy, while diminishing your chance for cancer and prolonging your lifespan. The World Health Care Organization defines PA as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. Physical inactivity, on the other hand, is the fourth leading cause of human mortality, causing an estimated 3.2 million deaths per year globally. Any activity counts-- walking, taking the stairway (up to five stories) instead the elevator, doing household chores, gardening, standing on the subway. You don't need to go to the gym, but you have to be physically active at least 30 minutes a day. It does not need to be 30 minutes straight but can be divided into smaller units of time.</p>

<p>Next come your sleeping habits. Sleeping significantly affects your mental and physical health. If you don’t sleep enough, your memory decreases, you become irritated easily, you argue more, and you get depressed or angry. Your brain needs sleep. Regular sleeping helps you maintain a healthy balance of the hormones that regulate your eating habits, telling you when you are hungry (ghrelin) or full (leptin). If you don't sleep enough, your ghrelin goes up and your leptin drops. Sleep deprivation increases your appetite; it increases your blood sugar level, which can lead to diabetes. When you are well rested, you feel less hungry. Sleep deficiency also makes you less productive at work or in school. As we know from news media, the lack of sleep has been the cause of many catastrophic accidents, like airplane crashes, the grounding of large ships, and even nuclear meltdown. The underslept surgeon is as dangerous as the drunk surgeon. In the US each year, underslept drivers cause about 100,000 car accidents, resulting in 1,500 deaths. So, sleep 7 to 8 hours per night and you’ll be safer for yourself and the people around you.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, social interaction is very important to maintain your mental and physical health. There is an evolutionary reason why social connection is important for your health. Early in human history, human survival required the protection of tribes and family. Isolation meant death. People who have friends live longer and are generally healthier. Lonely adults consume more alcohol, consume more sugar and fat, get less exercise, their sleep is less efficient and their lifespan in general is shorter. Many grandparents feel that caring for their grandchildren makes them not only happier but healthier. Social isolation leads to increased morbidity and mortality, especially in the older population. Some biomarkers of health in people who are deprived of social interaction are directly measurable: interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory agent, is directly related to diminished social interaction that can lead to age related disorders like Alzheimer, Parkinson, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, many cancers and cardiovascular diseases. My wife spends at least half an hour daily on the phone with her 95-year-old mother. Her mother is thriving despite living alone; I'm convinced that this daily talk with her daughter keeps her not only happier but mentally and physically healthy.</p>

<p>I hope that after reading this letter you are now convinced that if good mental and physical health requires some effort on your part, your efforts will be amply rewarded.</p>
